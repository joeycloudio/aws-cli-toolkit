# 🛠️ AWS CLI & Bash Scripting Reference

This is a personal reference repo where I collect useful AWS CLI commands, Bash scripts, and automation snippets learned through hands-on projects and labs.

The goal is to build a reliable toolkit for:

 ✅ AWS CLI automation  
 ✅ Bash scripting for cloud infrastructure  
 ✅ Troubleshooting and provisioning AWS resources  
 ✅ Real-world patterns and reusable scripts

## 📁 Structure

Each folder or file will contain:

 🔹 **Purpose**: What the script/command does  
 🔹 **Usage**: How to run it (with parameters if needed)  
 🔹 **Example Output**: (when applicable)

## 🚧 In Progress

This repo is a work in progress as I deepen my cloud infrastructure skills. Contributions not expected—just documenting my learning journey and making it easier to recall useful commands fast.

## 🧠 Why This Exists

Not every cloud project involves heavy code, but that doesn’t mean you can’t build a dev-friendly muscle memory around the AWS CLI and scripting. This repo is my way of staying sharp, consistent, and fast.
